# webpack-ssr

> A simple Vue 2.0 Webpack that supports server side rendering. Note this template is not suitable for production - for that you may want to use the [full webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack).

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible.

### Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init nguyendv/webpack-ssr my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### What's Included

- `npm run dev`: Webpack + `vue-loader` with proper config for source maps & hot-reload.

- `npm run build`: build with HTML/CSS/JS minification.

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader) and [docs for vue ssr](https://ssr.vuejs.org/en/). Also check out the [breaking changes in vue-loader@9.0.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/releases/tag/v9.0.0).

### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can fork this repo to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`:

```
